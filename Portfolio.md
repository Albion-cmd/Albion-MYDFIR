# Wilson Elan Oluwasemiloore | Cybersecurity Enthusiast
Early-career Information Security Analyst with hands-on exposure across Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), security operations, and penetration testing fundamentals. Demonstrated ability to assess technical risk through vulnerability assessment, web and API security testing, network analysis, and Linux system auditing, while aligning findings with organizational risk and compliance objectives.
Experienced in supporting security monitoring, incident response, and security awareness initiatives, with a strong understanding of ISO/IEC 27001, PCI-DSS, and audit-driven control validation. Technically proficient in network security, API security testing, log analysis, and security tooling (Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark), with the ability to document findings clearly and translate technical issues into business-relevant risk for non-technical stakeholders.
Brings a risk-aware, methodical mindset that bridges policy, process, and technical controls, enabling practical security improvements rather than checkbox compliance. Motivated by continuous hands-on learning and real-world impact, with a focus on strengthening organizational security posture through measurable, risk-based decision-making.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Understanding And Network Monitoring With Wireshark]
*   **Description:** Analyzed a pcap file from a simulated breach to identify malicious traffic and C2 communication.
*   **Skills:** Wireshark, Protocol Analysis, Threat Hunting
*   **Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UR2-IlzWthlRS9aqxHIPRy6bn4jZO2Ij?usp=sharing

### [Project 2: Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus]
*   **Description:** Performed a vulnerability scan against a Metasploitable2 VM, identified critical flaws, and authored a remediation report.
*   **Skills:** Nessus, Vulnerability Management, Risk Assessment, Report Writing
*   **Link:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/12c3b4u4cF2Wr87DqIQEPymmgAnBKInzx/view?usp=sharing

### [Project 3: Custom Python Port Scanner]
*   **Description:** Developed a custom multi-threaded network scanner in Python to identify active services and potential entry points on target hosts. Unlike linear scanners, this tool utilizes concurrent execution to probe 1,024 ports in under 10 seconds. It serves as a lightweight alternative to Nmap for rapid environment fingerprinting and custom reconnaissance tasks.
*   **Skills:** Network Protocol Analysis: Deep understanding of the TCP/IP stack and the Three-Way Handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).Python Programming: Mastery of socket programming, concurrency (threading), and command-line argument parsing (sys.argv).
Reconnaissance Methodology: Practical experience in active footprinting and identifying attack surfaces.
*   **Link:** https://github.com/Albion-cmd/Albion-MYDFIR/blob/main/PortScanner.sh

### [Project 4: Hardener Script & Suite-Setter For Kali]
*   **Description:** Engineered a comprehensive automation suite to transform a default Kali Linux installation into a hardened, production-ready workstation. The solution automates the implementation of "Least Privilege" principles, network isolation via firewall orchestration, and OPSEC-focused privacy controls (MAC spoofing). By reducing manual setup time from 45 minutes to 5 minutes, this project demonstrates a commitment to DevSecOps principles and efficient security operations.
*   **Skills:** Bash Scripting, Python 3. TCP/IP Networking, Firewall Management (UFW/Iptables), Socket Programming.
Security Ops: OS Hardening, OPSEC (Operations Security), Automation & Scripting, Linux System Administration.
*   **Link:** https://github.com/Albion-cmd/Albion-MYDFIR/blob/main/Kali-Hardener%20&%20Suite-Setter.sh

### [Project 5: Advanced Nmap Firewall Evasion & Traffic Analysis].
*    **Description:** Conducted a multi-stage security research project to bypass firewall filters and IDS/IPS systems using advanced Nmap flags. Validated evasion efficacy by performing deep packet analysis in Wireshark, focusing on identity masking, packet fragmentation, and raw Ethernet frame injection.
*    **Skills:** Network Security, Nmap, Wireshark, TCP/IP Protocol Analysis, Firewall Evasion Techniques.
*    **Link:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q_1Aq43LeYYIGs0poVp6DOm6Iglw3MGW?usp=sharing

###  [Project 6: Password Security & Hash Recovery Analysis]
*    **Description:** Conducted a hands-on technical lab in a controlled Kali Linux environment focused on the vulnerabilities of legacy encryption and weak password policies. The project involved extracting hash material from a password-protected ZIP archive and performing an offline dictionary attack to recover credentials. This research highlighted the critical gap between legacy encryption (ZipCrypto) and modern security standards.
*    **Key Technical Tasks:**
Hash Extraction: Utilized specialized tools to extract credential hash material from protected archives for offline analysis.
Encryption Identification: Identified and analyzed legacy ZipCrypto encryption to determine the most effective attack vector.
Advanced Recovery: Successfully recovered a weak password using John the Ripper, resolving wordlist compatibility and format issues during the process.
Security Validation: Demonstrated the efficacy of offline dictionary attacks against weak password policies and outdated encryption standards.Skills: Cybersecurity, Kali Linux, John the Ripper, Password Cracking, Hash Analysis, Encryption Standards (ZipCrypto vs. AES), Defense-in-Depth.

###  [Project 7: Web Application Penetration Testing Series (In View)]
*    **Description:**
Conducted multiple hands-on web application penetration testing projects within controlled lab environments to identify, exploit, and document common and advanced web vulnerabilities. These engagements followed structured penetration testing methodologies, emphasizing manual testing techniques over automated tooling. The projects focused on understanding real-world attack paths, validating security controls, and translating technical findings into actionable remediation guidance aligned with organizational risk.
*    **Key Technical Tasks:**
* Reconnaissance & Attack Surface Mapping:
Performed manual and automated reconnaissance to enumerate endpoints, parameters, hidden content, and API routes using browser-based testing, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and custom tooling.
* Input Validation & Injection Testing:
Identified and exploited input validation weaknesses including reflected and stored XSS, SQL injection patterns, command injection vectors, and insecure parameter handling.
* Authentication & Authorization Testing:
Tested login mechanisms, session management, and access controls, including broken object level authorization (BOLA), broken function level authorization (BFLA), and privilege escalation scenarios.
* Client-Side & Server-Side Security Analysis:
Analyzed client-side JavaScript behavior and server-side request handling to uncover trust boundary violations, insecure logic, and hidden functionality not exposed through the UI.
* Manual Exploitation & Proof of Concept Development:
Developed manual payloads and proofs of concept to validate vulnerabilities beyond automated scanner findings, ensuring accurate risk assessment and reducing false positives.
* Vulnerability Validation & Impact Assessment:
Confirmed exploitability of findings and evaluated technical and business impact, considering data exposure, account compromise, and downstream attack potential.
* Reporting & Remediation Guidance:
Produced structured penetration testing reports detailing findings, attack methodology, evidence, and prioritized remediation steps aligned with OWASP Top 10 and secure development best practices.
*    **Skills Demonstrated:**
