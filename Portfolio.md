Provisioned and configured Fleet Server to centrally manage Elastic Agents, enabling policy-based control of data collection and enforcing consistent telemetry ingestion across hosts.
* Elastic Agent Installation & Enrollment:
Installed Elastic Agent with elevated privileges to ensure full system visibility and enrolled the agent into Fleet using service tokens and trusted CA fingerprints, simulating enterprise endpoint onboarding workflows.
* System Telemetry & Log Ingestion:
Enabled the System integration to collect host-level telemetry including:
Authentication logs
Syslog events
CPU, memory, disk, and process metrics
* Host and agent metadata
Validated ingestion into logs-* and metrics-* data streams.
* Data View Creation & Validation:
Created and configured Kibana data views (logs-*, metrics-*) and validated live ingestion through Discover, confirming correct timestamping, field mapping, and ECS alignment.
* Operational Troubleshooting & Debugging:
Resolved real-world deployment issues including:
* Fleet Server HTTPS enforcement
